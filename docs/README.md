# Docs index

Use these docs as the source of truth. `README.md` intentionally stays short and links here.

- `docs/SCHEMA.md`: emitted JSON schemas + stability/determinism rules
- `docs/METHODOLOGY.md`: bytecode-first approach, verification loops, limitations
- `docs/RUNBOOK.md`: reproducible commands for scans/comparisons and how to interpret outputs
- `docs/DATASET_SNAPSHOTS.md`: how to attribute runs as `sui-packages` updates over time
- `docs/AGENTBEATS.md`: how this repository maps onto AgentBeats / “green agent” evaluation
- `benchmark/README.md`: benchmark harness usage (Phase I + Phase II)
